          <p>
            Between 1930 and 1940, the southwestern Great Plains region of the
            United States suffered a severe drought. Once a semi-arid grassland,
            the treeless plains became home to thousands of settlers when, in
            1862, Congress passed the Homestead Act. Most of the settlers farmed
            their land or grazed cattle. The farmers plowed the prairie grasses
            and planted dry land wheat. As the demand for wheat products grew,
            cattle grazing was reduced, and millions more acres were plowed and
            planted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Dry land farming on the Great Plains led to the systematic
            destruction of the prairie grasses. In the ranching regions,
            overgrazing also destroyed large areas of grassland. Gradually, the
            land was laid bare, and significant environmental damage began to
            occur. Among the natural elements, the strong winds of the region
            were particularly devastating.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the onset of drought in 1930, the overfarmed and overgrazed
            land began to blow away. Winds whipped across the plains, raising
            billowing clouds of dust. The sky could darken for days, and even
            well-sealed homes could have a thick layer of dust on the furniture.
            In some places, the dust drifted like snow, covering farm buildings
            and houses. Nineteen states in the heartland of the United States
            became a vast dust bowl. With no chance of making a living, farm
            families abandoned their homes and land, fleeing westward to become
            migrant laborers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his 1939 book The Grapes of Wrath, author John Steinbeck
            described the flight of families from the Dust Bowl: "And then the
            dispossessed were drawn west--from Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New
            Mexico; from Nevada and Arkansas, families, tribes, dusted out,
            tractored out. Car-loads, caravans, homeless and hungry; twenty
            thousand and fifty thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred
            thousand. They streamed over the mountains, hungry and
            restless--restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do--to lift,
            to push, to pick, to cut--anything, any burden to bear, for food.
            The kids are hungry. We got no place to live. Like ants scurrying
            for work, for food, and most of all for land." In all, 400,000
            people left the Great Plains, victims of the combined action of
            severe drought and poor soil conservation practices.
