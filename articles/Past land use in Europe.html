          <p>
            The development of natural and socio-ecologically adapted agroecosystems, which have the capacity to ease demand on food and resources and mitigate climate change, is a major challenge. Looking at past land-use systems and their socio-economic history increases our understanding of slow processes and low-frequency events. These underlying processes appear to be key in assessing whether modern land-use systems will lead to sustainability or collapse. In central Europe, phases of agricultural expansion and regression occurred with land clearance and reforestation back to the onset of agriculture, around 7500 years ago. Under natural conditions (except for short phases of severe climate deterioration in the early Holocene), the sheltering cover of vegetation and soil development largely mitigated geomorphic processes, resulting in a stable dynamic equilibrium.
         </p>

         <p>
            With the clearing of forests, the natural water and matter fluxes changed into anthropogenically driven systems with greatly accelerated processes and higher vulnerability to soil erosion. Repeated or extreme events forced by climate change may have affected the fertility of the land to an extent that it could no longer be cultivated. On a local- to regional scale, this may occur surprisingly rapidly, especially in strong single events. As the system develops, two outcomes may occur: a) Driving forces may progress slowly, causing gradual and predictable degradation, or b) Exceptional events may trigger catastrophic changes, forcing premature abandonment of agricultural land. 
         </p>
         Regardless of the rate of degradation, the system will evolve through a reorganization phase and ultimately reach a new equilibrium, where either naturally or anthropogenically driven processes dominate the overall system. As a result of these processes, erosion has changed soil conditions and patterns in many areas of Central Europe. Material has been washed downslope and gullies have incised, leading to the deposition of sediments at the slopes (colluvial layers), in floodplains (alluvial layers) or lakes (allochthonous input). These erosional landforms and depositional structures are geoarchives of past land use, human impact and climate change, at broad temporal (daily to millennia) and spatial (gully/slope to floodplains) scales. Efforts to retrieve these data have increased during the last few years
