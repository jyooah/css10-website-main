          iCare is a nonprofit organization dedicated to addressing the issue of
          soil degradation and promoting soil conservation. Founded in 2022 by a
          group of individuals who were concerned about the negative impacts of
          soil degradation on society, iCare aims to raise awareness and provide
          solutions to this growing problem. The organization provides a
          platform for individuals and communities to learn about the effects of
          soil degradation and to take action to protect and preserve the land.
          Through its campaigns and initiatives, iCare is working to ensure a
          safe and sustainable future for our land and the communities that
          depend on it.
