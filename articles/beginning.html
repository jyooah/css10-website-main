            Recent findings by an international study team show that people have
            been influencing the earth since well before the Industrial
            Revolution. Human activities have already greatly exacerbated soil
            erosion near lake basins on a worldwide basis some 4,000 years ago.
          </p>

          <p>
            The findings necessitated a multidisciplinary approach, with many
            sorts of analysis providing a more comprehensive picture of how
            human activities may be contributing to the accelerating erosion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The study's primary author, Jean-Philippe Jenny, a French
            geoscientist associated with the Max Planck Institute for
            Biogeochemistry and the Alpine Center for Research on Trophic
            Networks and Liminic Ecosystems, evaluated core sediment samples
            from 632 lake beds gathered from across the world. Lake sediment
            cores can be utilized as a natural archive of oscillations in soil
            erosion throughout time since sediments build at a constant pace in
            lakes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jenny and his colleagues extrapolated changes in lake sedimentation
            accumulation rates by combining sediment rates with radioactive
            carbon dating data from each site and discovered that 35% of the
            tested lakes have accelerated erosion over the previous 10,000
            years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interestingly, the acceleration in erosion began approximately 4,000
            years ago, and the researchers investigated methods to explain this
            pattern, concluding that people were the most likely culprit.
            Researchers discovered that changes in erosion were less connected
            to changes in precipitation and temperature, but increases in
            deforestation correlated with the rise in erosion. Jenny and his
            colleagues studied pollen samples from each lake bed location to
            provide a proxy for adjacent land tree coverage; they discovered
            that losses in tree cover were strongly associated with increased
            erosion. "At the time, deforestation was caused by humans since they
            were only starting to create agriculture," Jenny explained.
